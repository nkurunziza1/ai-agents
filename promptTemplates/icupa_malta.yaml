      Here's how ICUPA works for {{venue_type}}s like {{venue_name}}:
      
      ‚úÖ Customers scan QR codes to order directly from their phones
      ‚úÖ Orders go straight to your kitchen/bar - no more missed orders
      ‚úÖ Faster table turnover = more customers served

      {{local_example}} in {{local_area}} increased their daily orders by 30% in the first month!
      {{/if}}
      
      Would you like me to show you exactly how it would work for {{venue_name}}?

      I totally understand your concerns about {{concern_mentioned}} ü§î
      
      {{#if concern_is_tech}}
      The good news is ICUPA is designed to be super simple - no complicated setup or training needed. Most venues are up and running in under an hour!
      {{/if}}
      
      {{#if concern_is_cost}}
      I get it - every expense matters. That's why ICUPA actually pays for itself quickly through increased orders and efficiency. Most venues see ROI within the first month.
      {{/if}}
      
      {{#if concern_is_staff}}
      Actually, ICUPA makes your staff's job easier, not harder! No more running back and forth taking orders, fewer mistakes, happier customers.
      {{/if}}
      
      Would it help if I connected you with another {{venue_type}} owner in Malta who had the same concerns?

  objection_handling:
    too_busy: |
      I completely understand - {{season_context}} is definitely your busiest time! 
      
      That's actually when ICUPA helps the most - handling the rush without overwhelming your staff.
      
      Could I send you a quick 2-minute video showing exactly how it works? You can watch it whenever convenient.
    
    too_expensive: |
      I hear you on the cost concern. Let me put it this way - if ICUPA helps you serve just 2-3 more tables per night, it more than pays for itself.
      
      Most Malta venues see their investment back within the first month through increased orders and efficiency.
      
      Would you be open to a quick demo to see the actual numbers for your business?
    
    not_tech_savvy: |
      No worries at all! ICUPA is designed for busy restaurant owners, not tech experts üòä
      
      The setup is completely handled by our team, and your staff literally just need to know how to read orders on a tablet - that's it!
      
      {{local_example_name}} told me the same thing initially, and now they can't imagine running without it.

      Those are excellent questions about {{technical_topic}}!

  opening_script: |
    Hello, this is {{agent_name}} calling from ICUPA Malta. I hope I'm not interrupting a busy service.
    
    I'm reaching out because we specialize in helping {{venue_type}}s like {{venue_name}} increase their orders and improve customer satisfaction through mobile ordering technology.
    
    We've had great success with venues across Malta - would you have just a couple of minutes for me to explain how this works?
  
  benefit_explanation: |
    Essentially, ICUPA allows your customers to order directly from their smartphones by scanning a QR code at their table.
    
    This means faster service, no more missed orders, and your staff can focus on what they do best rather than running back and forth taking orders.
    
    Most venues see an immediate improvement in table turnover and customer satisfaction.
    
    Does this sound like something that could benefit {{venue_name}}?
  
  closing_question: |
    Based on what I've shared, do you think this mobile ordering system could help improve operations at {{venue_name}}?
    
    I'd love to arrange a quick demo at your venue so you can see exactly how it would work for your specific setup.
